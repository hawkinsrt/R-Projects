Open each CSV in Notepad and Crtl + H (Find and Replace)

Remove the comma in the following:
MEM,FAM -> MEM FAM
CHILDREN'S,CHOICE -> CHILDERN'S CHOICE
LEE,DAVIS -> LEE DAVIS

Now do the oppisite (add a comma) to the following:
CHILDREN'S CHOICE NEWRVR (MP) -> CHILDREN'S CHOICE, NEWRVR (MP)
EE DAVIS PEDIATRICS(MP) -> EE DAVIS, PEDIATRICS(MP)

Finally:
Replace | with "


X12 and X13 are places of service.  The should be one column but they almost all use a comma.  Issues arise with this is null because the null is one column.

First check to see if X12 is null

n_miss(claims$X12)

See if X14 is in the format [Letter][Number]( it should only return a few ZZ1.11, otherwise we got messes)
claims$X14 %>% str_subset("^.\\D")

See if X38 has any numbers in it (it should not and return character(0), if it returns "0" we got messes)
claims$X38 %>% str_subset("^\\d")




FY13, FY15, FY16 does not have X12 nulls, does not need to be seperated into df and df2

FY14, FY17, FY18 do have x12 nulls
