1. The headers file you sent over had 'SERVICE_TYPE' listed twice.  The first SERVICE_TYPE column has 148 levels(unique values) the second SERVICE_TYPE, which I have renamed PATIENT_TYPE and will referred to it as such from here forward, has 3 levels, INPT, OUTPT, and ED.  EMERGENCY SVCS in SERVICE_TYPE has the same number of rows as ED in PATIENT_TYPE. Is SERVICE_TYPE just a more granular version of PATIENT_TYPE?

The first SERVICE_TYPE is really REFERRAL_TYPE sometimes referred to as AUTHROIZATION_TYPE.Not require for every type of service.  Situation where something is real expensive often health care services require the provider to submit authorization. Outside of scope of this project. I'm going to change the first SERVICE_TYPE to REFERRAL_TYPE and revert PATIENT_TYPE to SERVICE_TYPE take note of this if we want our code to be interchangable with our datasets.

2. Follow up, is it safe to assume all rows with PATIENT_TYPE = ED are all the claims that went to the emergency room? Vice versa all rows with INPT or OUTPT are not ED visits.  If this is not the case, should I be looking at another column in addition to PATIENT_TYPE  or another value altogether to distinguish a ED visit (I noticed a 'EMERGENCY ROOM - HOSPITAL' value in the PLACE_OF_SERVICE_DESC and vaguely remember you explaining this column and TOB_CATEOGRY).  Basically if it isn't obvious I'm trying to create a indicator variable, "Was this claim a visit to the ED", how should this be handled.

Episode_seq needs to be different (which should be the case most of time.  Someone going to the ER twice in one day is very rare.)
FACILITY is the ER or INPT, PROFESSIONAL  is for the Doctor seen.
OUTPT can be FACILITY OR PROFSESSIONAL.

3.  What is the UNCLASSIFIED_ED column.
Tells you if that diagnosis is not classified. if 1 then PREVENTABLITY and not needed will be 0 cause there is no value for these.  UNCLASSIFIED_ED can be a percentage just like PREVENTABILITY and ER_NOT_NEEDED. IMPORTANT: handle PREVENTABLITY and ED_NOT_NEEDED separately.  PREVENTABLITY is more actionable/preferable then the ed_not_needed.  So if you have all three as 0’s for ED visit, that means it was an appropriate visit. If it’s 0 0 1, then we just don’t know what the PREVENTABILITY or ED_NOT_NEED is for that diagnosis.

4. ED_DISHCARGE_DX_DESC is just the crosswalk for DIAG_CODE_1 already joined for us, is that correct?  Furthermore PREVENTABILITY, ED_NOT_NEEDED_PROP, and UNCLASSIFIED_ED are values for DIAG_CODE_1 only.

Yes.

5. Can you explain PLACE_OF_SERVICE_DESC vs TOB_CATEGORY again.  The obvious pattern is a claim has one or the other but never both.  PLACE_OF_SERVICE_DESC has 50 levels while TOB_CATEGORY only has 5.

TOB_CATEGORY is a FACILITY claim.  PLACE_OF_SERVICE is a PROFESSIONAL claim.  Remember FACILITY is a place, PROFESSIONAL is a person.

6.  PCP_ID is the unique identifier for a specific human doctor.  MED_PRC is the location a PCP_ID practices medicine?  Multiple PCP_IDs can  work in single MED_PRAC?  This is just the PCP member list on a member's insurance profile.  This is not where the claim was or who serviced the patient.

Yes.

7.  MASTER_VENDOR_PROV_ID and VENDOR_PROV_ID.  I know vendor provider is a doctor or lab tech, master vendor is the org they work for. Is VENDOR_PROV_ID the individual that saw the patient on the claim?

Yes.

8,  You can have up to 18 DIAG_CODE on one claim.  When/How does a diagnosis get broken down into different claims (i.e multiple claims with the same EPISODE_SEQ vs one claim with multiple DIAG_CODEs).

General they don't try to break it up.  When a patient sees different individuals, that is where you get different claims with same EPISODE_SEQ.

9.  Whats the important distinction between FACILITY and PROFESSIONAL in the CLAIM_TYPE column.

FACILITY is the place, PROFESSIONAL is the person who saw you. ED will always be a FACILITY claim.
In addition to what I explained above: If it’s in a facility, it will have TOB- hospital, outpatient surgery center (like a place that only does appendix removals without overnight check ins). You still have to have a professional claim associated with that visit. ED always has a facility claim. Urgent care is an outpatient professional. 


10. You said the patient outreach program is carpet bombing the members population. Do they have even the basic of ED usage statistics?  Something as simple as Top 50 members who went to the ER that was 100 percent not needed in the past or Women who recently got pregnant/Had a baby.

Yes this is what they are using.  They know habitual ER users and pregnant women.

11. Is it possible to get us FIPS something that we can distinguish Rural vs Urban members.

Hard No.

12. HIPAA Training

Hard No.

Separately, if you have 3 ED visits that come out .3333 in the same column, that means you have 1 out of 3 of visits for that problem are not necessary? 

AMT_PAID is what VP paid, not what they charged…they might’ve charged $70, and VP paid $9. 

Pharmacy and care coordination is not accounted for here but for medical spend, it’s pretty comprehensive. 

Small potatoes to this business is very diff from small potatoes to any other business. $1 mil is a small potatoes. You start turning heads at $10s of mil. 

My thoughts on analysis first steps:
Focus on SERVICE_TYPE == 'ED' and the PREVENTABILTY score, and ED_DISCHARE_DX_DESC.  See what preventable stuff members are going to the doctor for. Then expand outside of SERVICE_TYPE == 'ED' Look into memebers who don't go to the doctor's office.  Try to find out if a member has a chronic condition.  Start creating indicator variables for these.  Try to get a broader view of diagnosis, need to bin 33,360 unique diagnosis into something more managage.  Cluster analysis?
