DIAG_CODE = Diagnosis code with decimal removed
ICD_VERSION = VERSION 9 or 10
DIAG_CODE_DESC = Virginia Premiers DESC
CCS_CATEGORY = VPs category system
CCS_CATEGORY_DESC = VPs category system description
CHRONIC_INDICATOR = Yes/No/NA is Diagnosis considered chronic | 5498 NAs
BODY_SYSTEM = 1-18 Categorization of CODE | 5498 NAs
BODY_SYSTEM_DESC = Description of the 1-18 codes | 6833 NAS BODY_SYSTEM NAs + "None" BODY_SYSTEMs
ED_NOT_NEEDED_PROP = Percent of cases where ED is not needed
PREVENTABILITY = Percent of cases ED would have been prevented with prior intervention
UNCLASSIFIED_ED = Percent of cases where ED score cannot be classified. IDK this one is weird.*
NumberOfClaims = Total count of claims CODE appears in
NumberOfED = Total count of claims CODE appear in where SERVICE_TYPE == 'ED'
NumberOfOTPT = Total count of claims CODE appear in where SERVICE_TYPE == 'OTPT'
NumberOfINPT = Total count of claims CODE appear in where SERVICE_TYPE == 'INPT'
AverageAGE = Average age of members who get diagnosed with this CODE
Pct_Female = Percent female who get diagnosed with this CODE
NumberOfED_NN = NumberOfED * ED_NOT_NEEDED_Prop**
NumberOfED_PRV = NumberOfED * PREVENTABILITY**

*You can interpret this if UNCLASSIFED_ED == 1 then VP has not created a scores for CODE
** If value = -1 then score was NA for CODE.  All CODE_2 - CODE-18*** that never appeared as a CODE_1 will not have a score and thus will have -1s for these columns. Some CODE_1s have NA scores as well but very few < 900
***To create this dataset I first gathered all 18 CODEs longways then aggregated until each line is a unique code.
